Attention to detail

## Code

### Early Warning System

Fail fast, fail early!

1. Linting - syntax and style
1. Code Spell Checker - typos

### Passes Lint

1. Indentation is perfect
1. Syntax is correct
1. Style is idiomatic

### Folder/File Organization

1. Logically organized
1. Consistent naming:
    1. `kebob-case` for folders and files
    1. Includes a README.md

## Practice

Growth requires lots of practice, which means lots of hands-on-keys typing.

1. Use the file as a draft surface for code
1. Write each part of each idea as it comes. Invite the next idea:
    1. No room for idea
    ```js
    if(x > 5) {|}
    ```
    1. Room for next idea(s)
    ```js
    if(x > 5) {
      |
    }
    ```
1. Keep code blocks perfect
    1. This is not idiomatic and arguably not semantic:
    ```js
    if(x > 5) { 
        console.log(x) ;}
    ```

## Process

Work incrementally while validating. Move system from one 
know good state to next know good state

### Known Good State

1. Break things into small chunks
1. Write a few lines **max**
1. Validate (check/test) that it worked
1. Commit

### Commit

1. Frequent commits
1. Strive for "why" (not "what")

## Pace

Above leads to good pace
