## Backend Review

Excellent commitment and execution:

> Being a software developer means doing what you can with the knowledge and resources you have available to you

Mostly high-level design and architecture issues

## Commitment

Commit to focus on:

1. Process - Incremental
1. Practice - Hands on keys typing. Code fearlessly
1. Product - Maintainable, quality, clean code

### Path to the Darkside

> Focusing on "getting it to work" and "knowledge acquisition" _leads to anger and frustration_. Work without regard to process and product and 
forever will technical debt rule your destiny

## JavaScript

1. How Values are Stored
1. How Prototypical Inheritance Works
1. (BONUS: How Scope Works)
1. Event Loop in the Browser
    1. Reentrant code

## DOM Manipulation

There are three kinds of DOM changes:

1. Changing the value of text nodes (often done via `.textContent` of 
wrapping element);
1. Setting a property or calling a method on an element
    * `el.disabled = true`
    * `el.classList.add('showing');`
    * `el.addEventListener('click', listener);`
    * `el.style.display = 'none';`
1. Controlling and changing the multiplicity of blocks of DOM
    1. Conditional - show or remove a block of DOM
    1. Repeated - repeat a block of DOM, splice a block of DOM
